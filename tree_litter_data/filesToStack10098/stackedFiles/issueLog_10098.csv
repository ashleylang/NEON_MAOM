From the inception of these two data products, the ‘vst_perplotperyear’ table was common to both; moreover, recent evolution of the ‘Non-herbaceous’ data product to include mapping and tagging of large-stature cacti, palms, and tree ferns meant that the ‘vst_mappingandtagging’ table was also shared across the two products. Splitting out the ‘vst_non-woody’ table into a separate product therefore created unnecessary complexity for data end-users who wished to understand the totality of vegetation structure measurements collected at a site where non-herbaceous perennial vegetation was present.","The ‘Woody plant vegetation structure’ (DP1.10098.001) and ‘Non-herbaceous perennial vegetation structure’ (DP1.10045.001) data products were bundled into the new ‘Vegetation structure’ data product (DP1.10098.001). The new product delivers all tables that contain vegetation structure data: vst_perplotperyear, vst_mappingandtagging, vst_apparentindividual, vst_non-woody, and the vst_shrubgroup table. The new data product delivers all NEON vegetation structure measurements in the way that most end-users would expect and eliminates potential confusion."

The new method selects plots for annual sampling such that plots are proportionally representative of the NLCD vegetation classes present in each site's Tower airshed, and the method maximizes collocation of Vegetation Structure measurements with annual TOS soil and plant diversity sampling.
