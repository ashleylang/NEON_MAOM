Plots to continue sampling for litterfall were selected to maintain spatial balance across the Tower airshed. In June 2020, plot selection at these sites was revised to prioritize stratification across vegetation types."

Data availability may be reduced during this time.","The primary impact of the pandemic on observational data was reduced data collection.

While all NEON litterfall samples are dried at 65C in the domain labs, they are sometimes then stored in paper bags or coin envelopes for weeks to months before being ground, transferred to vials, and shipped. During this time they may accumulate moisture, especially in humid areas. Subsequent testing revealed that %C data are likely underestimated by 1.5-2.5% due to this lack of re-drying prior to analysis. As vegetation samples tend to have high %C (20% - 55%), this bias may have only minor impacts on many analyses, but is something for end users to keep in mind. For the other parameters (%N, C:N, d15N, d13C), testing suggests there were no detectable differences between re-dried samples and originals.","Affected data have been flagged with dataQF = dryingProtocolError in the `ltr_litterCarbonNitrogen` table. For sample analysis dates starting in November 2020, all carbon-nitrogen samples are re-dried at 65C prior to analysis to drive out any residual moisture and improve data accuracy for % C. Samples collected in 2020 may have been analyzed before or after the change; check dataQF to determine which individual samples are affected."

Because of extended litter collection periods due to sampling limitations during COVID restrictions, the incidence of litter trap disturbance by resident black bears was unusually high.
